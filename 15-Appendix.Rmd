## A.1 Why should I install R on my computer?

RStudio Cloud cuts down on a lot of installation problems and it means that you have all the packages and functions you need already installed. However, it requires an internet connection to use and you may want your own version of R & RStudio for use in the future. 

## A.2 Windows

If you are using Windows, you should download and install the following:

* [R](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/)

* [R Studio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download)

* [RTools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/)

Once you've installed all three programs, restart your computer. Then, open RStudio (not R) and run the below code:

```{r}
install.packages("tidyverse")
```

This will install the tidyverse package on your computer. If you have any problems installing R, please let me know. 

## A.2 Mac

If you are using a Mac, you should download and install the following:

* [R](https://www.stats.bris.ac.uk/R/)

* [R Studio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download)

* [XQuartz](https://www.xquartz.org/)

If you have any issues installing R on your Mac, first, we recommend that you watch the [walkthrough by Danielle Navarro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ay25o485YXs&list=PLRPB0ZzEYegOZivdelOuEn-R-XUN-DOjd&index=1&t=113s).


Once you've installed all three programs, restart your computer. Then, open RStudio (not R) and run the below code:

```{r}
install.packages("tidyverse")
```

This will install the tidyverse package on your computer. If you have any problems installing R, please let me know. 

## A.3 Chromebook

You cannot download R or RStudio for the Chromebook at this time

## A.4 LaTeX

You can install the LaTeX typesetting system to produce PDF reports from RStudio. Without this additional installation, you will be able to produce reports in HTML but not PDF. To generate PDF reports, you will additionally need to install tinytex (Xie, 2021) and run the following code:

```{r}
install.packages("tinytex")

tinytex::install_tinytex()

```

## A.5 - GitHub

In order to get your copy of RStudio to talk to GitHub, you must install GitHub on your computer. This is relatively painless, and follow the instructions on [Happy Git with R](https://happygitwithr.com/install-git.html) for a full walkthrough. 

You will then need to get *your* copy of RStudio talking to GitHub, use the walkthrough provided earlier in this coursebook as a step-by-step guide. You should onlt have to do this *one time* on your personal computer. 

# Appendix - Updating R

From time-to-time, updated version of R, RStudio, and the packages you use (e.g., ggplot) will become available. Remember that each of these are separate, so they each have a different process and come with different considerations. We recommend updating to the latest version of all three at the start of each academic year.

## Updating RStudio

RStudio is the easiest component to update. Typically, updates to RStudio won't affect your code, instead they add in new features, like spell-check or upgrades to what RStudio can do. There's usually very little downside to updating RStudio and it's easy to do.

Click > Help > Check for updates

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, out.width="80%", fig.alt= ""}
knitr::include_graphics("images/update_rstudio.jpg")
```

## Updating Packages

Package developers will occasionally release updates to their packages. This is typically to add in new functions to the package, or to fix or amend existing functions. **Be aware that some package updates may cause your previous code to stop working**. This does not tend to happen with minor updates to packages, but occasionally with major updates, you can have serious issues if the developer has made fundamental changes to how the code works. For this reason, we recommend updating all your packages once at the beginning of each academic year (or semester) - don't do it before an assessment or deadline just in case!

To update an individual package, the easiest way is to use the `install.packages()` function, as this always installs the most recent version of the package.

To update multiple packages, or indeed all packages, RStudio provides helpful tools. Click Tools - Check for Package Updates. A dialogue box will appear and you can select the packages you wish to update. Be aware that if you select all packages, this may take some time and you will be unable to use R whilst the process completes.

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, out.width="80%", fig.alt= ""}
knitr::include_graphics("images/update_packages.jpg")
```

Occasionally, you might have a few problem packages that seemingly refuse to update, for me, rlang and vctrs cause me no end of trouble. These aren't packages that you will likely every explicitly load, but they're required beneath the surface for R to do things like knit your Markdown files etc.

If you try to update a package and get an error message that says something like Warning in install.packages : installation of package ‘vctrs’ had non-zero exit status or perhaps Error in loadNamespace(i, c(lib.loc, .libPaths()), versionCheck = vI[[i]]) : namespace 'rlang' 0.4.9 is being loaded, but >= 0.4.10 is required one solution I have found is to manually uninstall the package, restart R, and then install the package new, rather than trying to update an existing version. The installr package also has a useful function for uninstalling packages.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Load installr
library(installr)

# Uninstall the problem package
uninstall.packages("package_name")

# Then restart R using session - restart R
# Then install the package fresh

install.packages("package")

```


## Updating R

Finally, you may also wish to update R itself. The key thing to be aware of is that when you update R, if you just download the latest version from the website, you will lose all your packages. The easiest way to update R and not cause yourself a huge headache is to use the `installr` package. When you use the `updateR()` function, a series of dialogue boxes will appear. These should be fairly self-explanatory but there is a full [step-by-step guide](https://www.r-statistics.com/2015/06/a-step-by-step-screenshots-tutorial-for-upgrading-r-on-windows/) available for how to use installr, the important bit is to select "Yes" when it asked if you would like to copy your packages from the older version of R.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Install the installr package
install.packages("installr")

# Load installr
library(installr)

# Run the update function
updateR()

```

# Appendix - Building a Data-driven CV

Clone the public GitHub repo [data driven cv](https://github.com/UEABIO/data-driven-cv) and start working through the process of making a CV that reflects all of your amazing skills! 

* Don't forget there are multiple different templates to try! 

* While making your new GitHub Repo for your CV, consider making a copy of your final data project (clone from UEABIO to your personal repo) - so that you have something to showcase. If you get stuck just ask for help!
