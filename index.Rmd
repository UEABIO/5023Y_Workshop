# Introduction

```{r include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
# automatically create a bib database for R packages
knitr::write_bib(c(
  .packages(), 'bookdown', 'knitr', 'rmarkdown', 'palmerpenguins', 'lubridate', 'janitor', 'rstatix', 'ggsci', 'wesanderson', 'colorBlindness', 'patchwork', 'here', 'kableExtra', 'plotly'
), 'packages.bib')

knitr::opts_chunk$set(message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, eval=FALSE)
```

```{r klippy, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE, include=TRUE}
klippy::klippy(c('r', 'bash'), position = c('top', 'right'), tooltip_message = 'copy to clipboard', tooltip_success = 'Copied!')
```

## Approach and style
This book is designed to accompany the module BIO-5023Y for those new to R looking for best practices and tips. So it must be both accessible and succinct. The approach here is to provide just enough text explanation that someone very new to R can apply the code and follow what the code is doing. It is not a comprehensive textbook.

A few other points:

This is a code reference book accompanied by relatively brief examples - not a thorough textbook on R or data science

This is intended to be a living document - optimal R packages for a given task change often and we welcome discussion about which to emphasize in this handbook

Top tips for the course: 

**DON'T** worry if you don't understand everything

**DO** ask lots of questions! 


## Teaching

We have: 

* one lecture per week
* one workshop per week

These are both timetabled in-person sessions, and you should check [Timetabler](https://timetabler.uea.ac.uk/Timetable) for up to-date information on scheduling. However, all lessons can be accessed remotely through Collaborate, and **everything** you need to complete workshops will be available on this site. 

If you feel unwell, or cannot attend a session in-person because you need to self-isolate then don't worry you can access everything, and follow along in real time, or work at your own pace. 

Questions/issues/errors can all be posted on our [Yammer](https://web.yammer.com/main/groups/eyJfdHlwZSI6Ikdyb3VwIiwiaWQiOiI3OTAyMTk1NzEyMCJ9/all) page.


### Workshops

The workshops are the best way to learn, they teach you the practical skills you need to become an R wizard

## Introduction to R

[R](https://www.r-project.org/) is the name of the programming language itself and [RStudio](img/rstudio-ide.pdf) is a convenient interface.], which we will be using throughout the course in order to learn how to organise data, produce accurate data analyses & data visualisations.

Eventually we will also add extra tools like [GitHub](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3jLJU7DT5E) and [RMarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/)  for data reproducibility and collaborative programming, check out this short (and very cheesy) intro video.], which are collaboration and version control systems that we will be using throughout the course. More on this in future weeks.

By the end of this module I hope you will have the tools to confidently analyze real data, make informative and beautiful data visuals, and be able to analyse lots of different types of data.

The taught content this autumn will be given to you in several **worksheets**, these will be added to this dynamic webpage each week.

## Getting around on RStudio

All of our sessions will run on cloud-based software. All you have to do is make a free account, and join our Workspace `BIO-5023Y` the sharing link is [here](https://rstudio.cloud/spaces/84058/join?access_code=6c3uEkEUsNhbzUrttMcRq3SoSkQ4vKw%2FeYBoyBRu).

Once you are signed up - you will see that there are two `Spaces`

* Your workspace

* BIO-5023Y

Make sure you are working in the class workspace - there is a limit to the hours/month on your workspace, so all assigments and project work should take place in the `BIO-5023Y space`. 

Watch these short explainer videos to get used to navigating the environment.


### An intro to RStudio

<p>

RStudio

> Note - people often mix up R and RStudio. R is the programming language (the engine), RStudio is a handy interface/wrapper that makes things a bit easier to use.

### Using R Studio Cloud

RStudio Cloud works in exactly the same way as RStudio, but means you don't have to download any software. You can access the hosted cloud server and your projects through any browser connection (Chrome works best), from any computer.

## Reading

There are lots of useful books and online resources to help develop and improve your R knowledge. Throughout this webpage I will be adding useful resources for you. 

The core textbook you might want to bookmark is R for Data Science [@R4DS] but we will add others throughout the course, and their is a bibliography at the end which collects everything together! 

## Get Help! 

There are a **lot** of sources of information about using R out there. 
Here are a few helpful places to get help when you have an issue, or just to learn more

* The R help system itself - we cover this in Week one [Error]

* Vignettes - type `browseVignettes()` into the console and hit Enter, a list of available vignettes for all the packages we have will be displayed

* [Cheat Sheets](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/) - available at RStudio.com. Most common packages have an associate cheat sheet covering the basics of how to use them. Download/bookmark ones we will use commonly such as `ggplot2`, `Data transformation with dplyr`, `Data tidying with tidyr` & `Data import`.

* Google - I use Google constantly, because I continually forget how to do even basic tasks. If I want to remind myself how to round a number, I might type something like `R round number` - if I am using a particular package I should include that in the search term as well

* [Ask for help](https://web.yammer.com/main/groups/eyJfdHlwZSI6Ikdyb3VwIiwiaWQiOiI3OTAyMTk1NzEyMCJ9/all) - If you are stuck, getting an error message, can't think what to do next, then ask someone. It could be me, it could be a classmate. When you do this it is very important that you **show the code**, include the **error message**. "This doesn't work" is not helpful. "Here is my code, this is the data I am using, I want it to do X, and here's the problem I get". 


> Note - It may be daunting to send your code to someone for help. It is natural and common to feel apprehensive, or to think that your code is really bad. I still feel the same! But we learn when we share our mistakes, and eventually you will find it funny when you look back on your early mistakes, or laugh about the mistakes you still occasionally make!
